# A web site crawler 

The goal is to have a command line based web crawler to allow crawling a site and find broken links or pages throwing errors.
External links are ignored.

# Todo

To get a basic version:

- Make the crawler async.
- Change the command line arguments handling perhaps to use that package from the imap client?
